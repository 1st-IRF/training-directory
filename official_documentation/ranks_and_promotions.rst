Ranks and Promotions
======================

The 1st International Response Force operates on a system of ranks which are directly tied to the position that the member holds and their seniority within the group. They can be broadly viewed as a representation of time spent in the group and whilst we expected to be respected with respect to decisions in the unit both in and out of combat they do not confer any form of direct seniority in other contexts such as other games or in general conversation.

This runs contrary to some other units courtesies policies that require officers be addressed accordingly at all times which is **NOT** the case in the 1st IRF. Rank should be a measure of time spent in the unit and the level in the chain of command in reference to the formal activities of the unit.

Rank Structure
---------------

We use the following ranks within the 1st IRF. The promotion policies and guidelines are below - this section is purely to show what ranks we use and how they are configured:

**PV1 through to SPC**

These ranks are available to members of the infantry who are not in leadership positions. Rising through these ranks is mostly a matter of time in grade with a small amount of training.

**CPL through to SFC**

These ranks are available to members of the infantry who are in leadership positions ( fireteam leaders through to platoon sergeants ). Rising through these ranks requires a not insignificant time commitment as well as training requirements.

**SFC through to SGM**

These ranks are available solely to members of the special forces ODA teams. Normally a SFC would promote into the officer corps however members of the SF teams will instead progress through further NCO ranks and will not move to officer ranks.

**WOC through to CW2**

These ranks are available to members of the aviation detachment and are used for non leadership roles such as copilots, crew members or ground support.

**CW3 through to CW5**

These ranks are available to members of the aviation detachment in leadership roles such as pilots or squadron commanders.

**2LT through to MAJ**

These ranks are available to officers in both the infantry and aviation. These require a significant period of time spent in the NCO or WO ranks as well as additional leadership and tactical training programs. The number of officers in the unit is limited so these ranks are also subject to competative application.

Promotion Policy
-----------------

In the IRF, our promotion system is based on an adaption of real life. It uses a system based on five factors, Promotion points, Time in Service, Training, Promotion Board and Deployments.

Ranks are limited by the position you occupy. If you wish to reach the highest ranks, you must accept higher levels of leadership, responsibility or specialisation. In the event that you decide to move back to a position with a lower rank cap than your current rank, you will be capped at the rank of the position. Upon moving to a higher capped rank, your rank will be restored to its normal level, with no time on grade credit.

Promotion points are earned for attendance of events and training programs. Promotions points can also be removed for failing to attend events you have committed to and for negative disciplinary action.

Time in Service is the time since your last promotion. This means that to reach high ranks you must remain with the IRF for an extended period of time. Many of our members have been in the group for years; We are not a short term commitment.


**Interview when moving corps**

When moving from one set of ranks to another - such as SPC to CPL or SFC to 2LT - the member will be subject to an interview by members of the outbound rank structure. For example an NCO promoting to officer will be subject to an interview by at least two members of the officer corps. Both members of the interview panel have a veto on the final decision of the candiate. The two officers should be selected by the Unit Commander in order to provide a fair and unbiased consideration of the candidate.

Ranks in the Reserves
---------------------------

Members in the reserves are subject to the same set of promotion and rank requirements as active duty members. No penalty nor benefit is imposed on members within the reserve corps.
