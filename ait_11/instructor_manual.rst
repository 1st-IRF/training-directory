AIT Instructor Handbook
========================
.. danger::
  
  **NOT FOR TRAINEE USE**

  This handbook is designed to be used by instructors.

  We publish this information but we request that you do not read the instructor section until you have completed the course.

Instructor Outline
-------------------
**Runtime:** Two classes of approximately one and a half to two hours each.

**Class Size:** Between 2 and 8 trainees at any one time

**Instructors Required:** One Instructor for every four trainees

Introduction
-------------
AIT 11 is designed to provide members who have just graduated BCT with a solid base knowledge with which to progress in our infantry elements. It serves as the primary introduction to our tactical mecahnisms and our SOPs as well as providing members with an understanding of how further training will proceed.

AIT is also a chance for the recruit to get a glimpse of some of the more complicated roles in the unit such as leadership roles ( “that is covered at a leadership level” ) and specialists ( “T3C leads into a full medical corps”).

.. warning::
  
  If at any point a recruit reveals they have not read the documentation fully they should be removed from the session and told to apply for the next available time slot.

Stage 1 - Forming Up
---------------------
Instructors should form recruits up in front of the 23rd Division Memorial near the barracks area. Instructors should bring a truck to this location so they can carry recruits.

Students should be greeted curteously and provided with equipment necessary for the training. Once all students have arrived instructors should load recruits into the vehicles and proceed to Live Fire area north of the Barracks.

**Example:**
	“Welcome to AIT Phase I. This is the first of two phases of training where you will learn the fundamentals of movement formations as part of a fire team, movement techniques, and introductory battle drills for reacting to contact, assaulting an enemy position, and breaking contact. Upon completion of this phase of AIT, you will understand basic concepts that will allow you to operate effectively as a member of a dismounted fire team.”

	“Understand this before we start; we are aware that there are multiple methods for conducting various movements and battle drills. This training will familiarize you with the foundations of how our unit conducts these actions. There is a time and place to debate tactics and techniques and this is not it. At this time, are there any questions?”

	“You will need the following equipment to conduct this phase of AIT. No other equipment is necessary or authorized for this course. Also, until the live fire exercise, there is no reason for your weapon to be loaded. Ensure that magazines are removed from your primary and secondary weapon before we move to the training area.

	“Ok, at this time board the vehicle and we will move to the AIT Phase I training area”

Stage 2 - Safety Briefing
-------------------------
**Instructors should cleary explain the following points to recruits:**
 * All weapons will be clear and on safety unless explicitly instructed to load them by an instructor.
 * All live fire excercises will be done with a full awareness of the muzzle and trigger discipline will be maintained at all times.
 * This training segment does not require explosive of any kind.
 * Smoke grenades are the only acceptable pyrotechnic device for this training.
 * If any injuries occur all training will stop and all weapons will be made safe. A medical team will be called ASAP.
 
At this time trainees should move to the formations area.

Stage 3 - Fire Team Formations
------------------------------
Instructors should ensure recruits have a good view of each fire team formation on display.

Each formation should be explained clearly and the tradeoff between security and speed should be discussed and assessed in each case.

Finally the instructors should get the recruit class to form up in the formations to demonstrate their layout.

**Example:**

	“Ok trainees, we will now discuss the fundamentals of movement stances and element movement techniques. When we are complete, you will be able to move in various stances, understand the benefits of those stances, and have a basic understanding of movement techniques as part of a fire team.”

	“There are five basic movement stance mechanics that you can use while conducting a movement. The first is walking pace. In this stance, you will move at a normal walking pace with your weapon lowered or holstered. Watch this demonstration.”

	“Second is combat stance, weapon ready. In this stance, you will move at a slight jog with your weapon raised. This is a good stance for moving when engagement with a threat is expected as it will allow you to react quickly to acquire targets. Watch this demonstration.”

	“Third is combat stance, weapon lowered. In this stance, you will move at a slight jog with your weapon at the low ready, or low carry. This is the standard movement stance. Watch this demonstration.”

	“The fourth is jogging with weapon holstered. In this stance, you will move at a jog with your weapon holstered or slung on your back. This stance allows for faster movement, but limits reaction time to contact. Watch this demonstration.”

	“The final stance is sprinting. In this stance, you will move quickly at a sprint for a short duration of time. This is a good stance for covering ground quickly, such as when crossing a road, or moving between cover. Watch this demonstration.”

	“Bear in mind your movement will be limited based on your equipment load and effects on stamina. You will not be able to sprint if your stamina is low, and you will move slower in all stances when your stamina is depleted.”

Stage 4 - Fire & Manouvre
--------------------
Instructors will provide trainees with instruction on the types of bounding technique - alternating and succesive. Instructors should explain to the trainees what the purpose of each technique is and how to enact them.

**Example:**

	“Ok trainees, now we will discuss bounding as a member of a fire team. If you remember from basic training, bounding is used to close with the enemy while maintaining constant fires and movement between cover. The principles are no different for a fire team, with one exception; the fire team is larger than a buddy team.”

	“There are two standard bounding techniques used in a fire team; alternating, and successive bounding. Imagine that the fire team is on line and the positions are numbered from one to four. In alternating bounding, #1 and #2 will move to a position to the front and re-establish engagement with the enemy. Once set, #3 and #4 will move to a position past the other element and re-establish contact. This will continue until the team leader ceases movement. In successive bounding, #1 and #2 will move to a position to the front and re-establish contact with the enemy. Once set, #3 and #4 will move to a position on line with the other element (not past as in alternating), and re-establish contact. This will continue until the team leader ceases movement.”
	
Is the basic modern military low-level unit tactic used to maneuver on the battlefield in the presence of the enemy,  especially when under fire. It involves heavy use of all available cover, and highly-coordinated exchanges of rapid  movement by some elements of the squad or platoon while other elements cover the movement with suppressive  fire. It is used both to advance on enemy positions as part of an attack, or withdrawal from current positions under  attack by the enemy. The moving and supporting (suppressing) elements may be teams or individuals and may  
quickly and continuously exchange roles until the entire unit completes the maneuver objective.  

Fire and maneuver can be performed by any unit made up of at least two soldiers. The first part of the military  unit suppresses the enemy by firing from behind cover, while the second advances. After a short time, the  advancing unit will halt behind cover and open fire, allowing the first unit to advance. The two parts of the unit will  repeat the cycle until the objective is met. Enemy suppression can also be achieved with direct and/or indirect fire  from combat support units such as 4-1, 4-3 or Titan. 

To perform Fire and Maneuver, we use Bounding and Overwatch. 

**Overwatch**
	is a force protection tactic: the state of one small unit or military vehicle supporting another unit, while they  are executing fire and movement tactics. An over watching or supporting unit has taken a position where it  can observe the terrain ahead, especially likely enemy positions. This allows it to provide effective covering  fire for advancing friendly units. 

**Bounding overwatch**
	is a military tactic of alternating movement of coordinated units to allow, if necessary, suppressive fire in  support of offensive forward "Fire and Maneuver" 

	As members of a unit take an overwatch posture, other members advance to cover; these two groups  continually switch roles as they close with the enemy. This process may be done by Alternating Bounds and  Successive Bounds.  


**Alternating Bounds** 
	aka Leapfrogging, is accomplished by having the bounding unit move towards and past the overwatch unit.  This quickly covers more ground but leaves your units more vulnerable to contact. We usually try for a 6  second pass, but it does depend on available cover.  

**Successive bounds**
	is accomplished by having the bounding unit move to, but not past, the overwatch unit. So for example, if  Team A is the lead team, team B will move in line with them but never pass them. This covers less ground  than leapfrogging but leaves your units less vulnerable to contact. We usually try for a 3 second pass, but it  also depends on available cover. 

**Peeling**
 * Used to disengage from contact and move toward cover while providing returning fire. 
 * Verbalize; “Peeling”, “Set”. 
 * Once under cover the Fire Team Leader or Squad Leader continues the mission.

**Contact Disengage**
 * The Overwatch, Bounding Overwatch, and Peel can be used to disengage. ● Continue to put guns on target otherwise the disengagement can become a route. 

**Squad and Fire Team Rushes**
 * Successive and Alternating bounding on a fireteam and squad level principles still apply. A base of fire element covers a maneuver element and then alternates as you move. 

**Concealment**
 * Allows you to hide yourself but DOES NOT protect you from anything. A good example is a bush 
 * Use smoke to cover large open areas that your team may need to cross to conceal your movement. 

**Cover**
 * Effective cover is a vital part of keeping out of harm's way, when under contact. Cover should always be utilized; and here especially hardcover. 
 * Hardcover: trees, walls, defilade etc. Anything able to sustain a long period of damage from small arms fire. While it is effective against small arms fire it usually is not effective against tank shells or anti-tank rockets/grenades. 

**Defilade**
 * This one is important, it puts cover in front of you and above you. Basically, if you come upon a slope or a ditch and hide in there, you are covered from direct fire (but not indirect) and concealed from the air until they are directly on top of you. However, your back side is exposed so you need to switch if they’re coming from behind. 

**Sky lining**
 * This is the act of standing on a hill and having the sky as your background instead of the hill. This makes you very easy to spot. So do not crest hills unless you are prone if you can help it.

 * TAB + Scroll will toggle the volume of your voice. This  changes the range of your voice from 5m up to 50m. Most of the time you should remain on middle.


Stage 6 - AT Firing Procedure
----------------------

.. warning::
  
  This section is only for the MOS 11H - Antitank Crewman

Backblast 
~~~~~~~~~
 * Backblast is produced by the rocket propellent being vented from the back port of the weapon system. 
 * The M136 AT-4 Produces a backblast up to 100 meters from the rear of the weapon at ~45-degree angle. 

Firing a weapon system that produces backblast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Firing any weapon system that produces a backblast should be considered a buddy procedure. 
 * Weapon operator will identify target 
 * Request “Clear my backblast” 
 * His buddy will check behind him in his backblast area. Once it is deemed clear he will respond with “your backblast is clear” 
 * Weapon operator will acknowledge the clear. 
 * Exclaim “ROCKET” and then immediately fire the weapon. 

Demonstrate the proper firing procedure for any AT system. 
Allow students to each fire two M136 AT-4s and two M72A6 LAWs


7. Fire and Maneuver Exercise
-----------------------------
Move the class to the fire and maneuver range, have the class break down into their fire teams and explain the exercise to them. 
The point of the exercise is to teach the students the importance of communication and coordination during movement. 

Things you are looking for as an instructor. 
 * Communication between fireteam members. 
 * Communication between team leaders. 
 * Proper verbalization of action ex. BOUNDING!! SET!! 
 * Proper utilization of available cover and concealment. 
 * Proper smoke usage. 
 * Smart and calculated movement 
 
Instructors will act as OpFor and fire AROUND the students in order to create a combat environment. Students should never be actually engaged unless they present a glaring issue. Ex. isolating themselves, moving prematurely or alone or exposing himself from cover in a reckless manner. 
The students will have 30 minutes to complete the maneuver and the debrief should take no longer than 10 minutes as well. 

Stage 7 - Patrolling Fundamentals
--------------------------
Five Principles of Patrolling: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Security - Always maintain 360° security. 
 * Surprise - Do NOT be predictable, mix it up. Don’t take the same route each time.
 * Coordinated Fire - During combat, utilize coordinated fire to maximize suppression and destruction. This is the most efficient way to provide the most suppression while using the least  amount of ammo.  
 * Violence of Action – This is the unrestricted use of speed, strength, surprise and aggression  to achieve total dominance against your enemy. Use coordinated fire, etc. 
 * Control - While following the previous principles, you need to maintain control over the situation. Don’t lose focus on the objective. Don’t get fixated on a target and remember to  always maintain security. 

Rally Points:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Assembly Point - Large enough for the patrol to assemble in. (Gear up, Plan and Prepare to move.) 
 * Initial Rally Point - Will be the final crossing out of friendly territory and entering enemy controlled territory. 
 * Other Rally Points - Any points after the initial Rally Point and the last Rally Point. Can be anything from a Dismount Location to an Observation Point. 
 * Objective Rally Point - The last point, is used to set up and process the final plans if any changes have been made. Normally the Observation Point is overlooking the target. 

Offensive Patrolling:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 3 key elements that make up offensive patrolling: 
 * Assault: The assault element provides rear security during movement and also acts as the maneuvering element of the patrol. 
 * Support: The support element executes tasks that the squad cannot with the equipment that they have organic to them. 
 * Security: The security element provides security to the front during movement as well as screening in front of the patrol from 10 o'clock to 2 o’clock.

Patrol Formation / Conduct Under Fire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Point Man (Rifleman) should be facing forward. The last man (Asst. Automatic Rifleman) should  check the rear every few minutes. Everyman between them should have their head on a swivel (Head  turning Left to Right, then back again, repeating this.) as they may pick up something with their eye sight, the man across the street from them may not. 
 * OPFOR (1) As the example shows, a squad is doing a patrol in the "Staggered Column  Formation" and come across an enemy approaching from the front. Team 1 will push up and get  on a line formation, with the point man, providing suppressive fire as Team 2 & 3 move to get on  line with them. Depending on the type of terrain (left side of the road has an open flat field, while  right has a rocky forest) both teams may move to the same side to form a longer line and bring  more fire down on the enemy. 
 * OPFOR (2) As the example shows, if the column is engaged from the "North Side" of the map  (Right side of the road) the left line would cross the street and get on line with the "Right"  Column bringing the most amount of firepower down on the enemy. 

Stage 8 - Team Communication
---------------------

Proper Target Identification and Relaying Information (A D D R A C)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Alert – (See different contact types below) 
 * Direction – Compass bearing; Cardinal direction; Left, Right, Front, Rear; Tracers; Reference  Point; or Clock Face 
 * Description - Type of target; Foot mobile, Light armor, Tank, etc. 
 * Range - Distance to target (exact if possible, estimated if not) 
 * Assignment - Leaders assign who will engage what and with what weapon systems 
 * Control - Leaders determine when to give the order to fire if not already engaged. 

Difference Between “Contact”, “Movement”, “Civilian”, “Friendly”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Contact - I see or am being engaged by an enemy combatant that poses an immediate threat. 
 * Movement - I see movement by an unknown person that poses a possible threat. 
 * Civilian - I see a civilian that poses no threat. 
 * Friendly - I see a friendly unit 

ACE Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~

When pulling security after an engagement, team/squad leader should request an ACE report. ACE stands for: 
 * Ammunition, 100%-75% Green, 75%-50% Yellow, 50%-25% Red 25%-0% Black 
 * Casualties, Green – Perfectly fine, Yellow – “Walking Wounded”, Red – Combat ineffective, Black – Down 
 * Equipment, (more specifically any sort of special equipment; such as the AT-4).

SALUTE Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Size – How many? 
 * Activity – What are they doing? 
 * Location – Grid reference, Buildings? 
 * Unit – What type are they? 
 * Time – How long ago? 
 * Equipment – Any special Equipment? 

Echoing Orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Self-explanatory, simply "repeat" the orders out loud down the line passed from the fire team leader. 

Verbalize Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * When following an order (such as peeling), or just when doing something on your own (such as reloading, moving, set at a position) you always have to verbalize it! Keep talking, so your team leader and the fire team, knows your whereabouts and that his order is complete.

Stage 9 - Radio Communications Training
---------------------------------------
Instructors should ensure recruits have a 343 type radio on their person.

**Instructors will then walk recruits through how to:**
 * Change Channel
 * Set an alternate channel
 * Change Volume
 * Change Stereo settings to create multi ear effects
 * Broadcast on the radio.
 
Once the recruits have got their radios setup instructors should explain the you this is me format and walk recruits through performing a radio check. Instructors should also ask recruits to tell them how to respond to bad radio checks.

Once a radio check has been performed trainees should be walked through ACE and contact reports over the radio.

Finally - instructors should walk through PACE contigency plans and how to deal with signal disruption. It is often useful to explain how to react in the event of radio’s being jammed and scenarios that may cause that such an EOD team deploying a THOR jammer during IED disposal.

Stage 10 - Tactical Combat Casualty Care
-----------------------------------------
Instructors should meet recruits at the MOUT training facility.

Tactical Combat Casualty Care is taught verbally and without demonstration at the AIT level - however it should still be covered.

Start by talking through how to react to an injury. Routine pitfalls of this process include ensuring trainees understand not to render medical aid under fire and that once they begin rendering aid it should focus on bleeding control.

You should also explain that medics will not render frontline aid and that the casualty will need to be taken to the CCP for frontline medical aid.

You should also walk trainees through the concept of a battle buddy to ensure that if you are left unconcious from a wound someone is aware.

Finally walk them through applying a tourniquet with ACE and explain the handoff procedures to medical personnel ( detailed below for ease of reading ):

 * Go to the Triage area of the CCP
 * Give the medical personnel the roster number ( name ), element and cause of injury of the casualty.
 
You should run recruits through this as a role play excercise to ensure they are properly able to react to one of the team taking fire.

.. warning::
  DO NOT DISCHARGE ROUND WHILST TRAINING T3C.
  

Stage 11 - MOUT
----------------
.. danger::
  
  Ensure at the start of the MOUT section that no recruit is in possesion of a live grenade and that they are exclusively holding practise grenades (blue grenades) and stun grenades.

MOUT is a long section of the AIT and should be taught in the following format. For brevity this section will not detail the exact tactics used in MOUT and you should instead refer to the training material itself for SOP on execution of a given tactic.

Start by forming recruits up at the Bleacher of the glasshouse. You should begin by explaining what MOUT is and why it poses a unique set of challenges to an infantry element.

Start by talking them through approaching a structure and the stack formation. You should then take the trainees over to the room with a central breach on the far side of the glasshouse from the bleachers.

Walk trainees through the fatal funnel and how to perform a normal breach - one without an accelerated or explosive breach.

Ensure they are able to correctly stack - set - then move onto a point of domination. Repeat this until every member of the team can correctly execute.

Once the team has succesfully completed this excercise run the same excercise on the same room but with a practise grenade breach.

.. danger::
  
  Ensure only practise grenades are used for MOUT.

Next move onto the room with a corner breach and ensure they are able to breach it correctly and move to their points of domination.

At this stage take them into the corridors and explain the rolling T. Instructors will have them move around the glasshouse until they are satisfied with their performance. Instructors should ensure that this movement includes movement around corners, T-intersections and four way intersections.

Once this is complete instructors should walk trainees through how to breach and secure the two central rooms of the glasshouse that present interior room and short room scenarios.

At this stage trainees should enter the glass house and proceed to the Killhouse.

.. danger::
 
  Before entering the safehouse provide a full safety briefing around the use of controlled fire and check again that no one is carrying live explosives.

  Trainees should clear and safety their weapons before exiting the killhouse walls and should not load their weapons until they are inside the killhouse walls.

Once inside the killhouse instructors should move around inside the rooms and on the gangways to maintain good visability of the trainees.

Instructors should make corrections to poor technique on the fly as necessary.

Continue moving around the killhouse until all questions are addressed and the instructors are satisfied with the techniques of the recruits.

.. note::
  Whilst moving through the killhouse instructors should ensure that trainees are tested on a variety of breaches including using flash greandes and practise grenades.

  It is also a good idea to simulate some weapon failure - perhaps by getting one trainee to remove their magazine and simulate their weapon failing on entry.

Stage 12 - Mounting and Dismounting Procedures
----------------------------------------------

Mounting Crew Served Ground Vehicles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Form up with your gear ready to go for the mission. Be in a file-formation facing towards the vehicle, waiting. 
 * Await permission and orders to mount the vehicle. Permission comes from the driver/crew and orders come from your leader. 
 * Team leaders will step to the side make sure all of their subordinates are loaded and then load himself. 

Mounting Aircraft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Form up with your gear ready to go for the mission. Be in a file-formation at a 45 degree angle towards the vehicle avoiding any rotors, waiting. 
 * Await permission and orders to mount the vehicle. Permission comes from the pilot/crew and orders come from your leader. 
 * Team leaders will step to the side make sure all of their subordinates are loaded and then load himself. 
 
Dismounting
~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Await permission and orders to disembark the vehicle. Permission comes from the driver/pilot, and orders come from your leader. 
 * Clear the vehicle making sure to not walk behind it if it is a helicopter. The tail rotor WILL KILL YOU. 
 * Dismounting a ground vehicle the minimum accepted clearance is 20 meters (a 5 count will get you an appropriate distance away). 
 * Dismounting aircrafts the minimum accepted clearance is 35 meters. (a 8 count will get you an appropriate distance away).
 
Insertion
~~~~~~~~~
 * When you’re approaching, be ready to step off. You will usually be given an order to disembark such as being given numbers or by fire teams or squads. 
 * If no order is given unload from the rear of the vehicle (closest to the door) to the front (furthest from the door). 
 * Get out and get spacing from the vehicle. Remember, you want 360-degree security, so try to watch somewhere else other than what people are already watching. Calling your sector helps as well to avoid double coverage. 
 
Evacuation 
~~~~~~~~~~
 * Set up 360-degree security around the zone the vehicle will be picking you up in and let the zone be big enough that the vehicle can land/drive into your security and not hurt anyone. 
 * Once the vehicle has arrived, it’s just like Embarking on base. Lowest to highest with permission and orders be given first. Except this time, you have to tell people when you are in, so that the next person can automatically move to get onto the helicopter. 
 * Make sure to hold your security until it is your time to board.
 
.. note::

  Allow the students a couple attempts at loading and dismounting into the gator. Make sure they are forming a proper file. Requesting permission, loading their teams properly, and dismounting from back to front properly.

Stage 13 - Convoy Operations 
----------------------------

Communication 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As with everything, communication is key. Keep the information going on convoy net (assigned before convoy starts), and call out turns, speed changes, enter and exiting urban environments,  potential threats, maneuvers, etc. 

Call outs 
~~~~~~~~~
 * Turns: "Vic (short for "Vehicle") one, turning left" "Vic X, turning left" "Last vic, turning left" 
 * Last vehicle of the convoy should always call out the turn/change in movement, as "last vic"; so everyone knows the movement/change is complete. 

Speed should be consistent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * To do this, use the Delete key to set a speed governor at the current speed. You can then  just hold down the W key and maintain that speed. 

Gun Orientation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As with everything, we want to maintain 360-degree security. 
 * The gunners should always be alternating which side of the convoy they are watching. Starting with the lead vehicle watching the front, 2nd vehicle watching the left, 3rd vehicle  watching the right, etc... 
 * The very last vehicle’s gun should always be pointed to the rear of the convoy. 

Pushing Through Contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Unless you’re told otherwise, push through contact until you can find sufficient cover and then,  if ordered to do so, dismount, double back and eliminate the threat. Our priority is the vic and  everyone in it. 

Moving to Cover/Defilade:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Upon receiving fire, drivers should find the nearest cover available to protect the vehicle and allow Marines to dismount while still exposing the gunner to effectively return fire. 

Herringbone Formation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Pulling ~10 meters off the road, left to right, alternating with each vehicle in the convoy. Lead vehicle pulls off to the left, 2nd vehicle pulls off to the right, 3rd vehicle pulls off to the left, etc...

Types of Dismounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Soft: Only the passengers get out, driver and gunner stay in. Driver turns off engine. 
 * Hard: Everyone but the gunner gets out, driver stays near the door to quickly get into the vehicle if needed 
 * Full: Everyone gets out of the vehicle and gets away from it. 
 
Dismounting and Maneuvering with Vehicles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Always leave a driver and gunner in the vehicles. The exception to this being if the vehicle is stopped for an extended period of time, at which point the drive may dismount and stay adjacent to the vehicle. 
 * Always have the vehicle escorts (usually the rest of the vehicle’s fire team) move ahead of the vehicle to clear corners, openings, and down street crossings. A vehicle, whether it is a Hunter or a tank, should never be the lead element during mounted operations. 

Using a Vehicle for Cover:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**When vehicles are effective cover: **
 * When receiving small arms fire in the vicinity of the vehicle. Basically, getting suppressed from anything the vehicle is able to sustain, for a longer period of time. 
**When vehicles are not effective cover: **
 * When enemy tanks, aircraft, or rockets are firing at you. Anything that can destroy the vehicle renders the vehicle ineffective for cover.

  
Stage 14 - Land Navigation
--------------------------

Map Reading
~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Identifying terrain features such as, hills, contour lines, ridges, saddles, bowls, buildings, rocks, roads, cliffs, forests. 
 * Zoomed out the map will have a grid of 1km by 1km. 
 * Zoomed in the map will have a grid of 100m by 100m. 

Coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~
**4-Digit Coordinates**
 * Indicates a 1km x 1km area. 
 * Not accurate. 
 * Written/Read as "####". 
 * Example: "9238”: 92 across the top | 38 along the side. 
**6-Digit Coordinates** 
 * Indicates a 100m x 100m area. 
 * Fairly Accurate. 
 * Written/Read as "######" 
 * Third number is taken from within the 1km of the first two numbers. 
 * Sixth number is taken from within the 1km of the 4th and 5th numbers. 
 * Example: "564214”: 564 across the top | 214 along the side 
**Sector Reference** 
 * Indicates a 33m x 33m area. 
 * Accurate. 
 * Reference number derived by projecting a North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest compass rose onto the grid square. 
 * Written/Read as "###### NW/N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/C Sector" 
 * Example: "857547 NE" or "857547 NE Sector”: 857 across the top | 547 along the side | NE Sector indicates the upper right section inside the grid. 
**8-Digit Coordinates** 
 * Indicates a 10m x 10m area. 
 * Precise. 
 * Reference number derived by projecting another 10x10 grid onto the 100m x 100m grid square. 
 * Written/Read as "########" 
 * Fourth number is taken from within the 100m of the first 3 numbers. 
 * Eighth number is taken from within the 100m of the 5th through 7th numbers.  * Example: "56432146" :: 5643 across the top | 2146 along the side.

Compass Functions, Usage, and Situational Awareness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The Arrow** 
 * The Arrow and heading numbers always point North. 
 * The heading under the line is the way you are facing. 
**View Slot**
 * Look through the slot at an object/target and the heading can be read. 
**Compass Correlation** 
 * Continue looking at the target or Reference Point 
 * Open the map without looking away and the compass will be set to the same heading as the out-of-map compass. 
**Situational Awareness** 
 * Scanning: When taking a break for breath or stopping at cover, scan to look for targets. 
 * Scan 360 degrees. 
 * Use Binoculars or Scopes to check possible targets at a distance. 
 * Always try to scan from right to left.
